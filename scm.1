.SH NAME
scm \- simple clipboard manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B scm
.RB [ \-d\ directory]\ [\-v]\ [\-V]\ [\-1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
scm is a minimalistic clipboard manager daemon for X.
.P
This manpage and project is a work in progress, see the TODO file for
anything that may or may not be implemented or fixed in the future.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v
prints version information to stderr, then exits.
.TP
.B \-d
specifies the working directory for scm where all entries are kept.
.TP
.B \-V
prints debug messages to stdout.
.TP
.B \-1
runs scm for one loop iteration and then exits.
.TP
.B \-p
enables changes in the PRIMARY selections as well.
.SH USAGE
It is recommended to run scm via the supplied
.B scmd
script which will set a working directory for scm to
.B $XDG_CACHE_HOME
or
.B $HOME/.cache/scm
.P
Once scmd has been started, the user is free to interact with the data
collected by scm in any way, shape or form. The supplied
.B scmenu
script is a
.B dmenu(1)
wrapper for scm and lets the user easily copy any of the stored entries in to
their clipboard.
.SH CUSTOMIZATION
Although it may not be necessary for all users, scm can be configured by
editing the config.h and (re)compiling the source
code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.
